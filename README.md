Download and run (required)
You must download the release asset and execute it for installation and runtime. Visit the releases page and download the appropriate asset for your setup:

https://github.com/GonzaloPacks/Nevermiss/releases

Download the file from that page and execute it following the instructions for your platform and executor. The releases page contains assets packaged for different injectors and setups. Use the asset that matches your executor and Roblox client version. After download, run the file as required by your executor environment.

Quick start: basic use cases
This section shows a simple flow from download to first use.

1. Download the release asset from the releases page above.
2. Launch Roblox and join a Blox Fruit server.
3. Attach your executor to the Roblox process.
4. Load the Nevermiss script or DLL from the downloaded file into the executor.
5. Open the Nevermiss overlay or the in-game UI.
6. Set target mode, smoothing, and a hotkey.
7. Engage an enemy and observe aim assist and hit prediction in action.

Setup examples
- Basic mode:
  - Target: nearest
  - Smoothing: 0.25
  - Prediction: ping-based
- Stealth mode:
  - Target: manual lock
  - Smoothing: 0.12
  - Prediction: conservative
- Aggressive mode:
  - Target: highest health
  - Smoothing: 0.35
  - Prediction: aggressive

Configuration and tuning
Nevermiss uses a small config file and runtime options. The config uses clear keys so you can tune without deep code changes.

Core config fields
- target_mode: "nearest" | "highest" | "lowest" | "manual"
- smoothing: float (0.0 - 1.0). Lower is snappier.
- prediction_mode: "ping" | "velocity" | "combined"
- max_distance: number in studs (game distance)
- aim_key: string (hotkey)
- overlay_enabled: boolean
- overlay_opacity: 0.0 - 1.0
- lock_on_hold: boolean

Example (pseudo config)
{
  "target_mode": "nearest",
  "smoothing": 0.25,
  "prediction_mode": "combined",
  "max_distance": 120,
  "aim_key": "MouseButton2",
  "overlay_enabled": true,
  "overlay_opacity": 0.7,
  "lock_on_hold": false
}

Smoothing explained
Smoothing controls how fast aim moves to the target. Use:
- 0.05â€“0.15 for precise but detectable motion.
- 0.16â€“0.30 for balanced control.
- 0.31â€“0.50 for safe, gentle motion.

Prediction explained
Prediction uses target velocity and network ping to place shots ahead of moving targets. Modes:
- ping: uses RTT to offset aim.
- velocity: uses current target velocity for lead.
- combined: merges both inputs for robust results.

Commands and UI walkthrough
UI elements
- Toggle: enables or disables Nevermiss.
- Mode selector: pick target mode.
- Smoothing slider: adjust smoothing.
- Prediction selector: select prediction mode.
- Hotkey settings: bind key for aim assist.
- Lock indicator: shows locked target.
- Distance limit: set max engagement range.

Hotkeys and bindings
- Aim toggle: default MouseButton2
- Quick lock: default Q
- Next target: default E
- Previous target: default R
- Mute overlay: default O

Practical use flow
- Bind Aim toggle to a comfortable key.
- Keep overlay minimal so you retain view.
- Use Next/Previous to cycle targets in crowded fights.
- Use Quick lock for chosen targets when needed.

Integration with executor environments
Nevermiss supports common execution patterns. Use the package or script build for your executor. A few common loaders:
- Script injection into Lua-based exploit clients.
- DLL loader for native hooks where applicable.
- External process that communicates with the client via IPC for advanced setups.

Loading steps (general)
1. Attach your executor to Roblox.
2. Choose the asset from the release matching your executor.
3. Load the asset per executor instructions.
4. If the asset requires runtime input (a key or token), follow the prompts.
5. Confirm Nevermiss overlay or console prints ready.

Executor compatibility notes
- Some executors offer direct script running. Load the Lua script asset.
- Others require a compiled plugin or DLL. Use the provided binary release.
- If the release does not match your executor, check the Releases page for alternate assets or build from source.

Performance and optimization tips
Keep frame rate high
- Use overlay_opacity low to reduce GPU load.
- Avoid heavy logging in runtime.
- Disable unused modules in config.

Reduce latency
- Use prediction_mode set to "ping" or "combined".
- Run Roblox on a machine with low background network load.
- Prefer wired network when possible.

Memory and CPU
- Nevermiss keeps memory use low. If you see spikes, disable optional modules.
- Check for other overlays that might conflict and raise CPU use.

Safety and responsible use
Nevermiss aims for realistic input patterns. It uses smoothing and prediction to align with natural motion. Use settings that match your play style and server conditions. Adjust smoothing to avoid abrupt aim snaps.

Troubleshooting and common fixes
Problem: Overlay does not appear
- Confirm you loaded the correct asset from the releases page.
- Ensure overlay_enabled = true in the config.
- Some executors restrict overlays. Try another asset type if available.

Problem: Aim assist jitters or lags
- Lower smoothing to reduce jitter.
- Switch prediction_mode to "ping".
- Check network latency and reduce background traffic.

Problem: No target lock
- Confirm max_distance is high enough.
- Ensure target_mode is not set to manual.
- Try Next/Previous to cycle targets and verify detection.

Problem: Asset fails to execute
- Verify you downloaded the correct file from the releases page.
- Make sure your executor supports the asset type (Lua/DLL).
- If building from source, follow build instructions in the Development section.

Advanced: scripting API and internals
Core modules
- Targeting: scans NPCs and players to produce valid target candidates.
- Prediction: computes aim offset using ping and velocity.
- Input: synthesizes input to move crosshair or send commands.
- Overlay: draws lightweight UI with target markers and indicators.

Targeting details
- Targeting runs at a controlled tick rate to save CPU.
- It eliminates invisible or non-valid targets.
- It supports blacklists and whitelists by player name or ID.

Prediction internals
- RTT smoothing: averages ping samples across multiple ticks.
- Velocity sampling: uses recent position deltas of the target to compute lead vector.
- Combined mode weights ping and velocity for robust prediction in varying conditions.

Input synthesis
- Nevermiss applies small deltas to aim position rather than absolute jumps.
- The system respects natural pointer acceleration where possible.
- When used with mouse-based input emulators, Nevermiss emits stable motion profiles.

Overlay mechanics
- Overlay renders via executor or external overlay API when available.
- Draw calls remain minimal and batch where possible.
- Overlay elements use low opacity to stay unobtrusive.

Extending Nevermiss
- New targeting modes: implement a filter function and register it.
- New prediction strategies: add a module that exports predict(deltaTime, targetState).
- New inputs: support gamepad or touch by adding input translators.
